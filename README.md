# Simple_SHA256
 This is a simple C++ program that takes an input string from the user and computes its SHA256 hash using OpenSSL.
---

# Features
 - Accepts user input from the console.
 - Computes SHA256 hash using OpenSSL.
 - Displays the hash in hexadecimal format.
---

# Requirements
 - C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
 - OpenSSL development libraries installed
---

# Example Output
```bash
Enter a string to hash using SHA256: Hello123
SHA256 hash of "Hello123":
1ad8b9e77c93d2149637c21ad61b0beff86b6a34cc0e546139db0d1cf0c932e0
```

# Note
This program uses SHA256 from OpenSSL. The same input will always generate the same hash (i.e., it's deterministic).
